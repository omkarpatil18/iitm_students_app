# IIT Madras Students App
The Students App is an initiative to bring every student closer to the activities happening in the institute. It is a mobile application for IITM students for general purposes. A student can register mess and facilities complaints. Students will receive Schroeter updates as well as scorecards. Students can check upcoming EML lectures and get information on previous years' EML lectures.  T5E articles are also available on the app for students. Other handy features like an Institute map, student search, important contact, IITM calendars, etc. are provided in the app. This was an effort by 12 members of the Institute Mobile Operations team of IIT Madras in 2017-18.
